I am a data, security, and technology attorney for a company that provides comprehensive human resources solutions for small and midsize businesses. 

Prior to my current job, I was a privacy attorney at an [independent federal agency](https://pbgc.gov). Most of my time there was spent working on breach response, compliance, and training.

Prior to moving to the Privacy Office at the agency, I was in the Bankruptcy, Transaction, & Terminations group for approximately 14 years. I represented the agency in chapter 11 bankruptcy cases and corporate transactions involving companies that sponsor pension plans. I also advised the agency on ERISA and regulatory matters.

In college, I worked at the help desk and taught non-credit classes on UNIX and web technologies for the Academic Computing department. I've been building and administering servers in my spare time for about 20 years.
