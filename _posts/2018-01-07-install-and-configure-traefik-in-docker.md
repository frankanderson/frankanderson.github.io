# Part 3 of [Build Your Site or Blog on Docker, Traefik, & Ghost](2018-01-05-build-your-site-on-docker-traefik-ghost.md)

Before we get our Traefik 1.7 container up and running, we need to create a configuration file and an encrypted password so we can access the monitoring dashboard.

Install the **htpasswd** utility to create this encrypted password. You'll need to figure out which package contains it for your linux distro. You could install the full httpd server package, but that is a waste of space. On CentOS, you can search for all the packages containing htpasswd with `yum provides`:

`# yum provides *bin/htpasswd`
    
Which should show you what packages contain what we are looking for:

```
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror
Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile
 * base: linux.mirrors.es.net
 * epel: mirror.sfo12.us.leaseweb.net
 * extras: mirror.pac-12.org
 * updates: mirror.sfo12.us.leaseweb.net
httpd-tools-2.4.6-67.el7.centos.x86_64 : Tools for use with the Apache HTTP Server
    Repo        : base
    Matched from:
    Filename    : /usr/bin/htpasswd
    
httpd-tools-2.4.6-67.el7.centos.2.x86_64 : Tools for use with the Apache HTTP Server
    Repo        : updates
    Matched from:
    Filename    : /usr/bin/htpasswd
    
httpd-tools-2.4.6-67.el7.centos.5.x86_64 : Tools for use with the Apache HTTP Server
    Repo        : updates
    Matched from:
    Filename    : /usr/bin/htpasswd
    
httpd-tools-2.4.6-67.el7.centos.6.x86_64 : Tools for use with the Apache HTTP Server
    Repo        : updates
    Matched from:
    Filename    : /usr/bin/htpasswd
    
httpd-tools-2.4.6-67.el7.centos.6.x86_64 : Tools for use with the Apache HTTP Server
    Repo        : @updates
    Matched from:
    Filename    : /usr/bin/htpasswd
```

It looks like **httpd-tools** is the right package for CentOS, so let's install it:

`# yum install httpd-tools`

Now let's generate a secure password for our Traefik monitoring dashboard. Substitute `your_secure_password` with the password you'd like to use for the Traefik admin user:

`# htpasswd -nb admin your_secure_password`

The output from htpasswd will look something like this:

`admin:$apr1$ruca84Hq$mbjdMZBAG.KWn7vfN/SNK/`

Copy and paste this entire line and keep it somewhere safe. We'll use it in a little while.

Now we need to create a network inside Docker for all of the containers to share with the proxy (Traefik). Our containers will be able to talk to each other, but they will have to go through Traefik to get to the outside world. We'll call this network `traefiknet`.

`# docker network create traefiknet`

Now that we have all of the prerequisites in place, it is time to create our Traefik configuration file.

Traefik is just another container, so I will save its configuration file in a directory inside `/opt` as I do with all of my other containers. Create the directory and move into it:

```
# mkdir -p /opt/traefik
# cd /opt/traefik
```

### In the `traefik` directory, we can now create the 3 files we need. First, `traefik.toml`:

```
debug = false
checkNewVersion = true
logLevel = "ERROR"
defaultEntryPoints = ["https","http"]
    
[web]
address = ":8080"
[web.auth.basic]
users = ["admin:$apr1$ruca84Hq$mbjdMZBAG.KWn7vfN/SNK/"]
    
[entryPoints]
[entryPoints.http]
address = ":80"
[entryPoints.http.redirect]
entryPoint = "https"
[entryPoints.https]
address = ":443"
[entryPoints.https.tls]
    
[retry]
    
[docker]
endpoint = "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
domain = "EXAMPLE.COM"
watch = true
exposedbydefault = false
    
[acme]
email = "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
storage = "acme.json"
entryPoint = "https"
[acme.tlsChallenge]
OnHostRule = true
```

The different sections of this file start with a word in brackets. Before the first section, we set some logging and other administrative options and `defaultEntryPoints = ["https","http"]`. Setting those defaults will allow us to route traffic coming in over ports 80 (http) and 443 (https). We'll force everything to run over an encrypted connection in a little bit.

`[web]` section:

This is where we set up the port for the Traefik dashboard and set up our user and password. This is where you paste the output from `htpasswd`. If you leave out web.auth.basic and the `users` line, the Traefik dashboard will be available for everyone to see. You can also specify additional login by separating them with commas.

`[entrypoints]` section:

The `http` entry point handles port 80, while the `https` entry point uses port 443 for TLS/SSL. We will redirect all of the traffic on port 80 to the `https` entry point to force secure connections for all requests.

`[retry]` section:

This tells Traefik to resend a request if there is a network error.

`[docker]` section:

This is where we configure Traefik to use Docker as a backend. Because we are using CentOS, we need to set the socket endpoint. The `domain` setting is the default domain for the server. Although this is a default, it won't be used very often because we will usually specify domains per container by setting the `traefik.domain` label. I'll discuss that in the next post when we set-up Ghost. The `watch` setting tells Traefik to watch Docker for changes and dynamically update itself when new containers come online. If you set `exposedbydefault` to true, then all containers will be exposed immediately upon creation. Instead, we will specify the containers that we want to expose with the `traefik.enabled=true` label.

`[acme]` section:

This is the section where we configure Let's Encrypt certificates support. Acme is the name of the protocal that is used to communicate with Let's Encrypt. To have Traefik generate certificates for our hosts, replace `YOUREMAILHERE` with your actual email address. The `storage` setting specifies that we will store the information from Let's Encrypt in a JSON file called `acme.json`. We will create that file in a few minutes. The entryPoint setting needs to point to the entry point handling port 443, which in our case is the `https` entry point. The `onHostRule` tells Traefik to generatea certificate as soon as our containers with specified hostnames are created. If we wanted to wait to create the certificate until the first time that a request is made, we'd use a setting called `onDemand`. Using `onDemand` would result in a much longer response time for the first visitor, so I prefer the `onHostRule` method.

This part is actually amazing. Traefik is going to dynamically manage all of the certificates for any domain or subdomain that you add to your configuration. For every `Host` rule that appears in Traefik, it will communicate with Let's encrypt, obtain a key and certificate, and store them in the acme.json file. Since all of the SSL/TLS certificates are managed at the proxy (Traefik), you can change your endpoints (or **backends** in Traefik parlance), set-up load balancing, etc. without worrying about your encryption configuration.

> For example, I am going to point `frankanderson.com` at a Docker container running the blogging software Ghost. If I ever decide to move to another blogging system like Wordpress or Jekyll, then all I have to do is set-up a new container in Docker and tell Traefik that frankanderson.com now points to the new container. To anyone connecting to `frankanderson.com`, the change will be seamless.

### Second, create `docker-compose.yml` for the Traefik container in the `/opt/traefik` directory:

```
version: '2'
    
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:1.7-alpine
    command: --docker
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    networks:
      - traefiknet
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - /opt/traefik/traefik.toml:/traefik.toml
      - /opt/traefik/acme.json:/acme.json
    labels:
      - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:monitor.yourdomain.com" 
      - "traefik.port=8080"
    container_name: traefik
    
networks:
  traefiknet:
    external: true
```

What are we telling it to do:

* Pull the Traefik docker image. I use the alpine version because it is compact.
* Restart after a reboot.
* Map the HTTP and HTTPS ports to the Docker host so that Traefik receives all traffic over ports 80 and 443.
* Connect to the special Docker network named `web` that we created earlier.
* Mount the Docker sock so that it can communicate with the Docker daemon.
* Mount the traefik.toml configuration file.
* Mount the file that will hold our Let's Encrypt information.
* Tell Traefik that this container responds to requests for monitor.yourdomain.com.
* Tell Traefik that this container's service is listening on port 8080.
* Name this container.

The `labels` are where all the magic happens. I'll discuss them more in the next post.

### Third, create an empty file which will hold our Let's Encrypt information:

`# touch acme.json`

As you may recall from the `docker-compose.yml` file for Traefik, we'll mount this file inside the Traefik container.

Then lock down the permissions so that only `root` can read and write this file:

`# chmod 600 acme.json`

> You may be wondering why we have to create `acme.json` before we mount it in a Docker container when Docker will create directories all by itself. The answer is that Docker assumes that a non-existant mountpoint in the host system will be a directory, not a file. So if you want ti to mount a file, you need to create it before initializing your container.

### Create the Traefik container

Now we are finally ready to create the Traefik container. In the `/opt/traefik` directory, run the following command:

`# docker-compose up -d`

Which will result in something like this:
    

```    
Pulling traefik (traefik:1.7-alpine)...
1.5-alpine: Pulling from library/traefik
1160f4abea84: Already exists

Status: Downloaded newer image for traefik:1.5-alpine
Creating traefik ... 
Creating traefik ... done
```

It will take a few seconds to download the image and initialize the container, but once everything is done you can go to (if you set up your CNAME as described earlier).

If everything is working as intended, you'll be asked to enter your username and password and then see something like this:

In my next article, I'll discuss the comparatively easy task of adding containers to Traefik and Docker.
